# Features (completed and future)
## Essential (also: many default settings)
- [X] Implementation of Dijkstra's algorithm;
- [X] Consider black pixels as walls and white pixels as road;
- [X] Path from green area to red area;

## Advanced
- [X] Add the A-Star algorithm;
- [X] Add the possibility of choosing which algorithm to use
- [X] Add other DFS;
- [ ] Add other algorithms (BFS);
- [ ] Change colors of the starting point, ending point, walls, road, path...
- [ ] Consider a range of colors as walls (e.g. walls can be grays too, not just pure #000000 black);
- [X] Profiling;
- [ ] Support parallelization (if/when possible);
